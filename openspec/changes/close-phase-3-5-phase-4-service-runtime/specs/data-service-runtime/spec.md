# Spec: Data Service Runtime Closure

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Service data endpoints use PluginRuntime

All supported data endpoints SHALL execute through `PluginRuntime`.

#### Scenario: equity OHLCV endpoint uses runtime

Given the local service receives `GET /v1/equity/ohlcv?symbol=FPT`  
When the request is handled  
Then the service SHALL call `PluginRuntime.fetch("equity.ohlcv", ..., return_result=True)`.

#### Scenario: service does not use legacy Vnstock dispatch

Given a supported data endpoint is requested  
When the service fetches data  
Then it SHALL NOT instantiate legacy `Vnstock` UI objects or provider/explorer classes directly.

---

### Requirement: Canonical data endpoints

The service SHALL expose canonical read-only v1 data endpoints.

#### Scenario: equity endpoints exist

Given the service is running  
When a client calls `/v1/equity/ohlcv`, `/v1/equity/quote`, or `/v1/equity/intraday-trades`  
Then each endpoint SHALL map to the corresponding canonical dataset name.

#### Scenario: reference and company endpoints exist

Given the service is running  
When a client calls `/v1/reference/symbols` or `/v1/company/info`  
Then the service SHALL map the request to `reference.symbols` or `reference.company_info`.

#### Scenario: fundamental and fund endpoints exist

Given the service is running  
When a client calls fundamental or fund endpoints  
Then the service SHALL map them to canonical dataset names.

---

### Requirement: DataResult response envelope

All successful data endpoints SHALL return a stable response envelope with `data`, `meta`, and `diagnostics`.

#### Scenario: response includes metadata

Given a data request succeeds  
When the response is serialized  
Then `meta` SHALL include request ID, dataset, provider, quality status, fetched timestamp, source requested, and runtime path.

#### Scenario: response includes diagnostics

Given a data request succeeds  
When diagnostics are available  
Then the response SHALL include routing, provider, quality, and warning diagnostics where available.

#### Scenario: sensitive data is redacted

Given provider diagnostics or auth context contains sensitive fields  
When the response is serialized  
Then token, password, secret, bearer, api key, cookie, and authorization material SHALL NOT appear in the response.

---

### Requirement: Provider endpoints use plugin registry

Provider metadata endpoints SHALL use the plugin registry created by `default_plugin_registry()`.

#### Scenario: provider names come from plugin registry

Given the service handles `GET /v1/providers`  
When providers are listed  
Then provider names SHALL come from `PluginRegistry.names()`.

#### Scenario: capability matrix comes from plugin registry

Given the service handles `GET /v1/providers/capabilities`  
When capabilities are listed  
Then the response SHALL be based on `PluginRegistry.capability_matrix()`.

---

### Requirement: Auth status works without leaking secrets

The service and CLI SHALL expose safe auth status only.

#### Scenario: auth status endpoint returns safe data

Given an auth manager is configured  
When `GET /v1/auth/status` is called  
Then the response SHALL include authentication status and SHALL NOT include token material.

#### Scenario: CLI auth status works

Given credentials may or may not exist  
When `vnstock-auth status` is executed  
Then the command SHALL complete without requiring raw secrets to be printed.

---

### Requirement: Forbidden endpoints remain unavailable

The service SHALL NOT expose broker, trading, account, portfolio, transfer, margin, or REST login endpoints.

#### Scenario: REST login is unavailable

Given the service is running  
When a client calls `POST /v1/auth/login` or `POST /v1/auth/tcbs/login`  
Then the service SHALL return 404 or 405.

#### Scenario: trading endpoints are unavailable

Given the service is running  
When a client calls order, account, portfolio, trade, transfer, margin, or portfolio execution endpoints  
Then the service SHALL return 404 or 405.

---

### Requirement: Runtime error mapping

Runtime errors SHALL be mapped to stable HTTP error envelopes.

#### Scenario: unsupported dataset

Given a client requests an unsupported dataset  
When the service cannot map or route it  
Then the response SHALL be 404 with an `unsupported_dataset` or `not_found` error.

#### Scenario: provider fetch failure

Given `PluginRuntime` raises a provider fetch error  
When the service handles the error  
Then the response SHALL be 502 with a provider fetch error envelope.

#### Scenario: contract validation failure

Given validation is strict and contract validation fails  
When the service handles the error  
Then the response SHALL be 422.

---

### Requirement: Roadmap does not approve REST login

The roadmap SHALL align with command-based local auth.

#### Scenario: roadmap lists auth status only

Given the roadmap describes the REST data service  
When auth endpoints are listed  
Then only safe status/provider endpoints SHALL be listed.

#### Scenario: roadmap forbids REST login

Given the roadmap describes service auth  
When implementation boundaries are listed  
Then REST login/logout endpoints SHALL be explicitly out of scope.
